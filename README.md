# NoteTaker_Dark

For hiarchy-based **note-taking** and **study guides** (ideal for students). Uses a **dark theme** and **Open Sans** for easy legibility. Also lists use **less indentation** and **custom line spacing** for better skimming. 

## My note-taking style

#### Headers

- **H1** : Title of Book/Mardown File
- **H2**: Chapters/Main Topic
- **H3**: Sections
- **H4**: "Groups" list items below

#### Sentence Starters

- **::** : Definition (of parent list item). 
  - Use **:** after term, if definition can fit on the same line.
- **e.g**: example

#### Anywhere

- **Bold**: To emphasize important text
  - Usually, I use this for cram sessions. I bold all key terms and details I want to remember. Then, I skim through and try to recall.
